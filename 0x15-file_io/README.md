#FILE HANDLING IN C PROGRAMMING

## H1 TASK ZERO

This question is asking you to write a C function that reads a text file and prints it to the standard output.
The function is named *read_textfile* and takes two parameters: a pointer to a constant character array named *filename* that represents the name of the file to be read, and a *size_t* type variable named *letters*, which specifies the maximum number of letters to be read and printed.
The read_textfile function should return the actual number of letters that it could read and print from the file. If it fails to open or read the file, the function should return 0.
